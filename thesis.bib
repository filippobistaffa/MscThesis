The text is organized in four parts: strategic games, extensive games with perfect information, extensive games with imperfect information, and coalitional games.

Their focus is on the efficiency properties of stationary equilibria of strictly superadditive games when the discount factor 'delta' is sufficiently large. It is shown that delay and the formation of inefficient subcoalitions can occur in equilibrium, the latter for some or all orders of proposer. However, efficient stationary equilibrium payoffs converge to a point in the core as 'delta' approaches one. Strict convexity is a sufficient condition for there to exist an efficient stationary equilibrium payoff vector for sufficiently high 'delta'.

Moreover, the authors show that any variation (in a certain class) of their bargaining procedure which generates the Shapley value in the transferable utility setup must yield the consistent value in the general nontransferable utility setup.

  abstract={The aim of this paper is to examine the non-cooperative basis of the core. We provide mechanisms that are motivated closely by the very description of the core, and have the property that their non-cooperative equilibrium outcomes coincide with the core. For general economic environments we construct an extensive form mechanism in which each player proposes a status-quo and then also has an opportunity to recontract with any other coalition. A proposal to recontract is enforced if and only if it meets with the unanimous approval of such a coalition. We show that subgame perfect outcomes of this mechanism coincide with the core allocations of the underlying economy. We also consider situations, such as labor managed firms, in which the mechanism designer does not know the set of feasible allocations but can observe the output (utility).},

Our approach is based on a factor graph representation of the constraint network. It builds a tree structure by eliminating dependencies between the functions and variables within the factor graph that have the least impact on solution quality. It then uses the max-sum algorithm to optimally solve the resulting tree structured constraint network, and provides a bounded approximation specific to the particular problem instance. In addition, we present two generic pruning techniques to reduce the amount of computation that agents must perform when using the max-sum algorithm. When this is combined with the above mentioned approximation algorithm, the agents are able to solve decentralised coordination problems that have very large action spaces with a low computation and communication overhead. We empirically evaluate our approach in a mobile sensor domain, where mobile agents are used to monitor and predict the state of spatial phenomena (e.g., temperature or gas concentration). Such sensors need to coordinate their movements with their direct neighbours to maximise the collective information gain, while predicting measurements at unobserved locations. When applied in this domain, our approach is able to provide solutions which are guaranteed to be within 2\% of the optimal solution. Moreover, the two pruning techniques are extremely effective in decreasing the computational effort of each agent by reducing the size of the search space by up to 92\%.}

  abstract={Many economic organizations have some relational structure, meaning that economic agents do not only differ with respect to certain individual characteristics such as wealth and preferences, but also belong to some relational structure in which they usually take different positions. Two examples of such structures are communication networks and hierarchies. In the literature the distinction between these two types of relational structures is not always clear. In models of restricted cooperation this distinction should be defined by properties of the set of feasible coalitions. We characterize the feasible sets in communication networks and compare them with feasible sets arising from hierarchies.},

@article{Clauset:SIAM2007,
    abstract = {{Power-law distributions occur in many situations of scientific interest and have significant consequences for our understanding of natural and man-made phenomena. Unfortunately, the empirical detection and characterization of power laws is made difficult by the large fluctuations that occur in the tail of the distribution. In particular, standard methods such as least-squares fitting are known to produce systematically biased estimates of parameters for power-law distributions and should not be used in most circumstances. Here we describe statistical techniques for making accurate parameter estimates for power-law data, based on maximum likelihood methods and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic. We also show how to tell whether the data follow a power-law distribution at all, defining quantitative measures that indicate when the power law is a reasonable fit to the data and when it is not. We demonstrate these methods by applying them to twenty-four real-world data sets from a range of different disciplines. Each of the data sets has been conjectured previously to follow a power-law distribution. In some cases we find these conjectures to be consistent with the data while in others the power law is ruled out.}},

    abstract = {{Networks of coupled dynamical systems have been used to model biological oscillators, Josephson junction arrays, excitable media, neural networks, spatial games, genetic control networks and many other self-organizing systems. Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks 'rewired' to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them 'small-world' networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon (popularly known as six degrees of separation. The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.}},

  abstract={Many real-life settings—such as communication networks, sensor networks,
or the electricity grid—require the development of decentralised mecha-
nisms that allow agents to organize into stable coalitions whose potential
membership is restricted by a graph. To meet these challenges, in this paper
we develop a novel graphical model representation scheme for coalitional
games defined over graphs, and exploit this representation to devise decen-
tralised algorithms leading to the formation of core-stable coalition struc-
tures. For games defined over trees, we propose an algorithm that allows
agents to identify a stable coalition structure. That is, an optimal coalition
structure along with a payoff allocation such that the resulting pair is in the
core of the game. Similarly, for arbitrary graphs, we develop an algorithm
that either outputs a core element—or, alternatively, detects core emptiness.
Both algorithms build upon well-known message passing algorithms from
the GDL family [20, 17] which we extend to this setting.
