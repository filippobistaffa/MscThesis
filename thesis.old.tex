\section{Metric}

The definition of coalitional game, as said before, is based on the existance of a \textit{worth function} $w : 2^N \to \mathbb{R}$ (sometimes called also \textit{characteristic function}), which defines how ``good'' and ``valuable'' a certain coalition is, mapping all possible coalitions to a specific payment, satisfying $w( \emptyset ) = 0$.

In some formulations of game-theory problem, this function is given as an input, but in the contexts  

In this particular context (the energetic domain), a worth function should evaluate the aggregate profile of the given coalition and return a
.
The first problem choosing How does one define how ``good'' a coalition is?

Another goal in the definition of a good metric suitable to this particular problem is to find one that is not \textit{superadditive}. One function is \textit{superadditive} when:
$$w ( S \cup T ) \geq w (S) + w (T)$$
This property simply states that bigger coalition are not worse than the smaller ones, so it's always convenient for an agent to join a coalition rather than stay alone. It's obvious that this will always lead to the formation of the grand coalition, since it must have a value greater or equal than any other subset of agents.

This kind of solution is obviously out of interest and unreasonable, as it would imply putting every agent in the problem in one big set, which is a trivial operation.



In the following sections two 

\subsection{Load diversity factor}

The first approach used in the definition of a metric is to focus on the ``smoothness'' of the aggregate profile obtained summing the energetic profiles. 

The definition 

$$
\frac{\sum_{k \in P_{i,j}} {max}_t P_k\left(t\right)}{{max}_t \sum_{k \in P_{i,j}} P_k\left(t\right)}
$$
